I'm Lisa (ru: _Лиза Василенко_), a PhD student at IMDEA Software Institute.

## My Research Interests

I like type theory, software verification and functional programming
 
My main expertise is relational refinement types.

I work with Niki Vazou and Gilles Barthe on the implementation of a relational type system for Haskell.

## Personal Stuff

I read fiction, watch films, swim, draw, dance swing, and take long walks around Madrid shooting pictures.
