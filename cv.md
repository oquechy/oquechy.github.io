I'm a PhD student at IMDEA Software Institute.

My research interests are type theory, functional programming, and software verification.

## Research

### Relational Types for Haskell
Designed and implemented an algorithmic relational type system for Haskell as a part of Liquid Haskell project. Currenly, I work on verification of probabilistic Haskell programs using relational typing.

### An Expressive Type System for Stream Processing (thesis)
Designed a type system with row polymorphism for big data processing. Queries such as `select *, id from X join Y` which contain wildcards and joins particularly benefit from the use of rows.

### Translation of Intersection Types to System F (coursework)
Implemented a translation of a typing judgement from a STLC with intersection types to a System F. The translation is sound in the subsystems of rank two. The algorithm is known as antiunification.
