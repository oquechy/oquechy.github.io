i'm a PhD student at IMDEA Software Institute

my research interests are type theory, functional programming, and software verification

## Research

### Relational Types for Haskell
designed and implemented an algorithmic relational type system for Haskell as part of the Liquid Haskell project. i'm now adding support for monadic effects

### An Expressive Type System for Stream Processing (thesis)
designed a type system with row polymorphism to verify the correctness of streaming queries. queries such as `select *, id from X join Y` which contain wildcards and joins particularly benefit from the use of rows

### Translation of Intersection Types to System F (coursework)
implemented a translation of a typing judgement from a STLC with intersection types to a System F. the translation is sound in the subsystems of rank two. the algorithm is known as antiunification
